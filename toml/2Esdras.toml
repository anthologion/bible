" Go thy way, and shew my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have done against me; that they may tell their children's children: ", #{1:5}
" Because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have offered unto strange gods. ", #{1:6}

verses=[
" In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart: ", #{3:1}
" For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon. ", #{3:2}
" And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said, ", #{3:3}
" O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people, ", #{3:4}
" And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee. ", #{3:5}
" And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward. ", #{3:6}
" And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number. ", #{3:7}
" And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments. ", #{3:8}
" And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them. ", #{3:9}
" And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these. ", #{3:10}
" Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men. ", #{3:11}
" And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first. ", #{3:12}
" Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham. ", #{3:13}
" Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will: ", #{3:14}
" And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed. ", #{3:15}
" And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude. ", #{3:16}
" And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai. ", #{3:17}
" And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age. ", #{3:18}
" And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel. ", #{3:19}
" And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them. ", #{3:20}
" For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him. ", #{3:21}
" Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still. ", #{3:22}
" So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David: ", #{3:23}
" Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein. ", #{3:24}
" When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee, ", #{3:25}
" And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart: ", #{3:26}
" And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies. ", #{3:27}
" Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion? ", #{3:28}
" For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. ", #{3:29}
" For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it. ", #{3:30}
" I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion? ", #{3:31}
" Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob? ", #{3:32}
" And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments. ", #{3:33}
" Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel. ", #{3:34}
" Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments? ", #{3:35}
" Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.", #{3:36}

" And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer, ", #{4:1}
" And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High? ", #{4:2}
" Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee: ", #{4:3}
" Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh. ", #{4:4}
" And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past. ", #{4:5}
" Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me? ", #{4:6}
" And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise: ", #{4:7}
" Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven. ", #{4:8}
" Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of them. ", #{4:9}
" He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know; ", #{4:10}
" How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight? ", #{4:11}
" Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore. ", #{4:12}
" He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel, ", #{4:13}
" And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods. ", #{4:14}
" The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country. ", #{4:15}
" The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it. ", #{4:16}
" The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them. ", #{4:17}
" If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn? ", #{4:18}
" I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods. ", #{4:19}
" Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also? ", #{4:20}
" For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens. ", #{4:21}
" Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding: ", #{4:22}
" For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect, ", #{4:23}
" And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy. ", #{4:24}
" What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked. ", #{4:25}
" Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away, ", #{4:26}
" And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities. ", #{4:27}
" But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come. ", #{4:28}
" If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good. ", #{4:29}
" For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing come? ", #{4:30}
" Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth. ", #{4:31}
" And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill? ", #{4:32}
" Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil? ", #{4:33}
" And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded. ", #{4:34}
" Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward? ", #{4:35}
" And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance. ", #{4:36}
" By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled. ", #{4:37}
" Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety. ", #{4:38}
" And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth. ", #{4:39}
" So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her. ", #{4:40}
" Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman: ", #{4:41}
" For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them. ", #{4:42}
" From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee. ", #{4:43}
" Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore, ", #{4:44}
" Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come. ", #{4:45}
" What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not. ", #{4:46}
" And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee. ", #{4:47}
" So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still. ", #{4:48}
" After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still. ", #{4:49}
" Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed. ", #{4:50}
" Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days? ", #{4:51}
" He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.", #{4:52}

" If thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thou punish them with thine own hands. ", #{5:30}
" Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me, ", #{5:31}
" And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more. ", #{5:32}
" And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for Israel's sake: lovest thou that people better than he that made them? ", #{5:33}
" And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment. ", #{5:34}
" And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother's womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel? ", #{5:35}
" And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the dross that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered, ", #{5:36}
" Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know. ", #{5:37}
" And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his dwelling with men? ", #{5:38}
" As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me? ", #{5:39}
" Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people. ", #{5:40}
" And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us? ", #{5:41}
" And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is no swiftness of the first. ", #{5:42}
" So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner? ", #{5:43}
" Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein. ", #{5:44}
" And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now also bear them that now be present at once. ", #{5:45}
" And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why dost thou it not together, but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once. ", #{5:46}
" And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time. ", #{5:47}
" Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in their times. ", #{5:48}
" For like as a young child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which I created. ", #{5:49}
" And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age. ", #{5:50}
" He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee. ", #{5:51}
" Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast now brought forth like those that were before, but less of stature? ", #{5:52}
" And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise. ", #{5:53}
" Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were before you. ", #{5:54}
" And so are they that come after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over the strength of youth. ", #{5:55}
" Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature.", #{5:56}

" For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit. ", #{7:13}
" If then they that live labour not to enter these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them. ", #{7:14}
" Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art but a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou art but mortal? ", #{7:15}
" Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing that is to come, rather than that which is present? ", #{7:16}
" Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish. ", #{7:17}
" Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide. ", #{7:18}
" And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the Highest. ", #{7:19}
" For there be many that perish in this life, because they despise the law of God that is set before them. ", #{7:20}
" For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, even as they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment. ", #{7:21}
" Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spake against him, and imagined vain things; ", #{7:22}

" And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him. ", #{13:3}
" And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire. ", #{13:4}
" And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea ", #{13:5}
" But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it. ", #{13:6}
" But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not. ", #{13:7}
" And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight. ", #{13:8}
" And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war: ", #{13:9}
" But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests. ", #{13:10}
" And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was afraid. ", #{13:11}
" Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable Multitude. ", #{13:12}
" And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said, ", #{13:13}
" Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive my prayer: ", #{13:14}
" Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream. ", #{13:15}
" For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are not left behind! ", #{13:16}
" For they that were not left were in heaviness. ", #{13:17}
" Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind. ", #{13:18}
" Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare. ", #{13:19}
" Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said, ", #{13:20}
" The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that thou hast required. ", #{13:21}
" Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation: ", #{13:22}
" He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty. ", #{13:23}
" Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead. ", #{13:24}
" This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea: ", #{13:25}
" The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind. ", #{13:26}
" And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm; ", #{13:27}
" And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitude that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation: ", #{13:28}
" Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth. ", #{13:29}
" And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth. ", #{13:30}
" And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another. ", #{13:31}
" And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending. ", #{13:32}
" And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another. ", #{13:33}
" And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting. ", #{13:34}
" But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion. ", #{13:35}
" And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands. ", #{13:36}
" And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest; ", #{13:37}
" And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto me. ", #{13:38}
" And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him; ", #{13:39}
" Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land. ", #{13:40}
" But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt, ", #{13:41}
" That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land. ", #{13:42}
" And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river. ", #{13:43}
" For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over. ", #{13:44}
" For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth. ", #{13:45}
" Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come, ", #{13:46}
" The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace. ", #{13:47}
" But those that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders. ", #{13:48}
" Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain. ", #{13:49}
" And then shall he shew them great wonders. ", #{13:50}
" Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea? ", #{13:51}
" And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time. ", #{13:52}
" This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art here lightened. ", #{13:53}
" For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought it. ", #{13:54}
" Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother. ", #{13:55}
" And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will speak other things unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things. ", #{13:56}
" Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he did in time; ", #{13:57}
" And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall in their seasons: and there I sat three days.", #{13:58}

" For yet a little, and iniquity shall be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness shall reign among you. ", #{16:52}
" Let not the sinner say that he hath not sinned: for God shall burn coals of fire upon his head, which saith before the Lord God and his glory, I have not sinned. ", #{16:53}
" Behold, the Lord knoweth all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts: ", #{16:54}
" Which spake but the word, Let the earth be made; and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and it was created. ", #{16:55}
" In his word were the stars made, and he knoweth the number of them. ", #{16:56}
" He searcheth the deep, and the treasures thereof; he hath measured the sea, and what it containeth. ", #{16:57}
" He hath shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word hath he hanged the earth upon the waters. ", #{16:58}
" He spreadeth out the heavens like a vault; upon the waters hath he founded it. ", #{16:59}
" In the desert hath he made springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, that the floods might pour down from the high rocks to water the earth. ", #{16:60}
" He made man, and put his heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding. ", #{16:61}
" Yea and the Spirit of Almighty God, which made all things, and searcheth out all hidden things in the secrets of the earth, ", #{16:62}
" Surely he knoweth your inventions, and what ye think in your hearts, even them that sin, and would hide their sin. ", #{16:63}
" Therefore hath the Lord exactly searched out all your works, and he will put you all to shame. ", #{16:64}
" And when your sins are brought forth, ye shall be ashamed before men, and your own sins shall be your accusers in that day. ", #{16:65}
" What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels? ", #{16:66}
" Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all trouble. ", #{16:67}
" For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall take away certain of you, and feed you, being idle, with things offered unto idols. ", #{16:68}
" And they that consent unto them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and trodden under foot. ", #{16:69}
" For there shall be in every place, and in the next cities, a great insurrection upon those that fear the Lord. ", #{16:70}
" They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but still spoiling and destroying those that fear the Lord. ", #{16:71}
" For they shall waste and take away their goods, and cast them out of their houses. ", #{16:72}
" Then shall they be known, who are my chosen; and they shall be tried as the gold in the fire. ", #{16:73}
" Hear, O ye my beloved, saith the Lord: behold, the days of trouble are at hand, but I will deliver you from the same. ", #{16:74}
" Be ye not afraid neither doubt; for God is your guide, ", #{16:75}
" And the guide of them who keep my commandments and precepts, saith the Lord God: let not your sins weigh you down, and let not your iniquities lift up themselves. ", #{16:76}
" Woe be unto them that are bound with their sins, and covered with their iniquities like as a field is covered over with bushes, and the path thereof covered with thorns, that no man may travel through! ", #{16:77}
