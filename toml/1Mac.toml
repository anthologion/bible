verses=[
" And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first over Greece, ", #{1:1}
" And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth, ", #{1:2}
" And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of many nations, insomuch that the earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up. ", #{1:3}
" And he gathered a mighty strong host and ruled over countries, and nations, and kings, who became tributaries unto him. ", #{1:4}
" And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he should die. ", #{1:5}
" Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive. ", #{1:6}
" So Alexander reigned twelves years, and then died. ", #{1:7}
" And his servants bare rule every one in his place. ", #{1:8}
" And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves; so did their sons after them many years: and evils were multiplied in the earth. ", #{1:9}
" And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks. ", #{1:10}
" In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, who persuaded many, saying, Let us go and make a covenant with the heathen that are round about us: for since we departed from them we have had much sorrow. ", #{1:11}
" So this device pleased them well. ", #{1:12}
" Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them licence to do after the ordinances of the heathen: ", #{1:13}
" Whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen: ", #{1:14}
" And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief. ", #{1:15}
" Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of two realms. ", #{1:16}
" Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy, ", #{1:17}
" And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death. ", #{1:18}
" Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took the spoils thereof. ", #{1:19}
" And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a great multitude, ", #{1:20}
" And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof, ", #{1:21}
" And the table of the shewbread, and the pouring vessels, and the vials. and the censers of gold, and the veil, and the crown, and the golden ornaments that were before the temple, all which he pulled off. ", #{1:22}
" He took also the silver and the gold, and the precious vessels: also he took the hidden treasures which he found. ", #{1:23}
" And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly. ", #{1:24}
" Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were; ", #{1:25}
" So that the princes and elders mourned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the beauty of women was changed. ", #{1:26}
" Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness, ", #{1:27}
" The land also was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered with confusion. ", #{1:28}
" And after two years fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude, ", #{1:29}
" And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: for when they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel. ", #{1:30}
" And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it on fire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on every side. ", #{1:31}
" But the women and children took they captive, and possessed the cattle. ", #{1:32}
" Then builded they the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them. ", #{1:33}
" And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, and fortified themselves therein. ", #{1:34}
" They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there, and so they became a sore snare: ", #{1:35}
" For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel. ", #{1:36}
" Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it: ", #{1:37}
" Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her. ", #{1:38}
" Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honour into contempt. ", #{1:39}
" As had been her glory, so was her dishonour increased, and her excellency was turned into mourning. ", #{1:40}
" Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people, ", #{1:41}
" And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of the king. ", #{1:42}
" Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath. ", #{1:43}
" For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws of the land, ", #{1:44}
" And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings, in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths and festival days: ", #{1:45}
" And pollute the sanctuary and holy people: ", #{1:46}
" Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts: ", #{1:47}
" That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation: ", #{1:48}
" To the end they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances. ", #{1:49}
" And whosoever would not do according to the commandment of the king, he said, he should die. ", #{1:50}
" In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, and appointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities of Juda to sacrifice, city by city. ", #{1:51}
" Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit every one that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the land; ", #{1:52}
" And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoever they could flee for succour. ", #{1:53}
" Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side; ", #{1:54}
" And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in the streets. ", #{1:55}
" And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire. ", #{1:56}
" And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament, or if any committed to the law, the king's commandment was, that they should put him to death. ", #{1:57}
" Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites every month, to as many as were found in the cities. ", #{1:58}
" Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God. ", #{1:59}
" At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised. ", #{1:60}
" And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew them that had circumcised them. ", #{1:61}
" Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing. ", #{1:62}
" Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant: so then they died. ", #{1:63}
" And there was very great wrath upon Israel.", #{1:64}

verses=[
" In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin. ", #{2:1}
" And he had five sons, Joannan, called Caddis: ", #{2:2}
" Simon; called Thassi: ", #{2:3}
" Judas, who was called Maccabeus: ", #{2:4}
" Eleazar, called Avaran: and Jonathan, whose surname was Apphus. ", #{2:5}
" And when he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Juda and Jerusalem, ", #{2:6}
" He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was delivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary into the hand of strangers? ", #{2:7}
" Her temple is become as a man without glory. ", #{2:8}
" Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy. ", #{2:9}
" What nation hath not had a part in her kingdom and gotten of her spoils? ", #{2:10}
" All her ornaments are taken away; of a free woman she is become a bondslave. ", #{2:11}
" And, behold, our sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, is laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned it. ", #{2:12}
" To what end therefore shall we live any longer? ", #{2:13}
" Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore. ", #{2:14}
" In the mean while the king's officers, such as compelled the people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice. ", #{2:15}
" And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his sons came together. ", #{2:16}
" Then answered the king's officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren: ", #{2:17}
" Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards. ", #{2:18}
" Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Though all the nations that are under the king's dominion obey him, and fall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent to his commandments: ", #{2:19}
" Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers. ", #{2:20}
" God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances. ", #{2:21}
" We will not hearken to the king's words, to go from our religion, either on the right hand, or the left. ", #{2:22}
" Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king's commandment. ", #{2:23}
" Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar. ", #{2:24}
" Also the king's commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down. ", #{2:25}
" Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did unto Zambri the son of Salom. ", #{2:26}
" And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me. ", #{2:27}
" So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city. ", #{2:28}
" Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness, to dwell there: ", #{2:29}
" Both they, and their children, and their wives; and their cattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them. ", #{2:30}
" Now when it was told the king's servants, and the host that was at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king's commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness, ", #{2:31}
" They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day. ", #{2:32}
" And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live. ", #{2:33}
" But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the king's commandment, to profane the sabbath day. ", #{2:34}
" So then they gave them the battle with all speed. ", #{2:35}
" Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid; ", #{2:36}
" But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth will testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully. ", #{2:37}
" So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, and they slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle, to the number of a thousand people. ", #{2:38}
" Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, they mourned for them right sore. ", #{2:39}
" And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen, they will now quickly root us out of the earth. ", #{2:40}
" At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight against him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were murdered im the secret places. ", #{2:41}
" Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law. ", #{2:42}
" Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselves unto them, and were a stay unto them. ", #{2:43}
" So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour. ", #{2:44}
" Then Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars: ", #{2:45}
" And what children soever they found within the coast of Israel uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly. ", #{2:46}
" They pursued also after the proud men, and the work prospered in their hand. ", #{2:47}
" So they recovered the law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of kings, neither suffered they the sinner to triumph. ", #{2:48}
" Now when the time drew near that Mattathias should die, he said unto his sons, Now hath pride and rebuke gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation: ", #{2:49}
" Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers. ", #{2:50}
" Call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time; so shall ye receive great honour and an everlasting name. ", #{2:51}
" Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness? ", #{2:52}
" Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment and was made lord of Egypt. ", #{2:53}
" Phinees our father in being zealous and fervent obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. ", #{2:54}
" Jesus for fulfilling the word was made a judge in Israel. ", #{2:55}
" Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation received the heritage of the land. ", #{2:56}
" David for being merciful possessed the throne of an everlasting kingdom. ", #{2:57}
" Elias for being zealous and fervent for the law was taken up into heaven. ", #{2:58}
" Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by believing were saved out of the flame. ", #{2:59}
" Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth of lions. ", #{2:60}
" And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that put their trust in him shall be overcome. ", #{2:61}
" Fear not then the words of a sinful man: for his glory shall be dung and worms. ", #{2:62}
" To day he shall be lifted up and to morrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought is come to nothing. ", #{2:63}
" Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men in the behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory. ", #{2:64}
" And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel, give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you. ", #{2:65}
" As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, even from his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battle of the people. ", #{2:66}
" Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avenge ye the wrong of your people. ", #{2:67}
" Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to the commandments of the law. ", #{2:68}
" So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers. ", #{2:69}
" And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sons buried him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him.", #{2:70}

" Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead. ", #{3:1}
" And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that held with his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of Israel. ", #{3:2}
" So he gat his people great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he made battles, protecting the host with his sword. ", #{3:3}
" In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelp roaring for his prey. ", #{3:4}
" For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt up those that vexed his people. ", #{3:5}
" Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered in his hand. ", #{3:6}
" He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever. ", #{3:7}
" Moreover he went through the cities of Juda, destroying the ungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel: ", #{3:8}
" So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of the earth, and he received unto him such as were ready to perish. ", #{3:9}
" Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel. ", #{3:10}
" Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain, but the rest fled. ", #{3:11}
" Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and Apollonius' sword also, and therewith he fought all his life long. ", #{3:12}
" Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of the faithful to go out with him to war; ", #{3:13}
" He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdom; for I will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, who despise the king's commandment. ", #{3:14}
" So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel. ", #{3:15}
" And when he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, Judas went forth to meet him with a small company: ", #{3:16}
" Who, when they saw the host coming to meet them, said unto Judas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight against so great a multitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faint with fasting all this day? ", #{3:17}
" Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company: ", #{3:18}
" For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of an host; but strength cometh from heaven. ", #{3:19}
" They come against us in much pride and iniquity to destroy us, and our wives and children, and to spoil us: ", #{3:20}
" But we fight for our lives and our laws. ", #{3:21}
" Wherefore the Lord himself will overthrow them before our face: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them. ", #{3:22}
" Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown before him. ", #{3:23}
" And they pursued them from the going down of Bethhoron unto the plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of them; and the residue fled into the land of the Philistines. ", #{3:24}
" Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren, and an exceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round about them: ", #{3:25}
" Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and all nations talked of the battles of Judas. ", #{3:26}
" Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he was full of indignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, even a very strong army. ", #{3:27}
" He opened also his treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for a year, commanding them to be ready whensoever he should need them. ", #{3:28}
" Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time; ", #{3:29}
" He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him. ", #{3:30}
" Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money. ", #{3:31}
" So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates unto the borders of Egypt: ", #{3:32}
" And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again. ", #{3:33}
" Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and Jerusalem: ", #{3:34}
" To wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place; ", #{3:35}
" And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, and divide their land by lot. ", #{3:36}
" So the king took the half of the forces that remained, and departed from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through the high countries. ", #{3:37}
" Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king's friends: ", #{3:38}
" And with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded. ", #{3:39}
" So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plain country. ", #{3:40}
" And the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of them, took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into the camp to buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also of Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined themselves unto them. ", #{3:41}
" Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries were multiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in their borders: for they knew how the king had given commandment to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them; ", #{3:42}
" They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortune of our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary. ", #{3:43}
" Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion. ", #{3:44}
" Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased. ", #{3:45}
" Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel. ", #{3:46}
" Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes, ", #{3:47}
" And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their images. ", #{3:48}
" They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days. ", #{3:49}
" Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away? ", #{3:50}
" For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low. ", #{3:51}
" And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest. ", #{3:52}
" How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help? ", #{3:53}
" Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice. ", #{3:54}
" And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens. ", #{3:55}
" But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law. ", #{3:56}
" So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus. ", #{3:57}
" And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary: ", #{3:58}
" For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary. ", #{3:59}
" Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do.", #{3:60}

" Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and removed out of the camp by night; ", #{4:1}
" To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress were his guides. ", #{4:2}
" Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and the valiant men with him, that he might smite the king's army which was at Emmaus, ", #{4:3}
" While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp. ", #{4:4}
" In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us ", #{4:5}
" But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men, who nevertheless had neither armour nor swords to their minds. ", #{4:6}
" And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong and well harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; and these were expert of war. ", #{4:7}
" Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault. ", #{4:8}
" Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. ", #{4:9}
" Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have mercy upon us, and remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this host before our face this day: ", #{4:10}
" That so all the heathen may know that there is one who delivereth and saveth Israel. ", #{4:11}
" Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them. ", #{4:12}
" Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they that were with Judas sounded their trumpets. ", #{4:13}
" So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain. ", #{4:14}
" Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand men. ", #{4:15}
" This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuing them, ", #{4:16}
" And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuch as there is a battle before us, ", #{4:17}
" And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and after this ye may boldly take the spoils. ", #{4:18}
" As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a part of them looking out of the mountain: ", #{4:19}
" Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host to flight and were burning the tents; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done: ", #{4:20}
" When therefore they perceived these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the host of Judas in the plain ready to fight, ", #{4:21}
" They fled every one into the land of strangers. ", #{4:22}
" Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches. ", #{4:23}
" After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever. ", #{4:24}
" Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day. ", #{4:25}
" Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysias what had happened: ", #{4:26}
" Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged, because neither such things as he would were done unto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him were come to pass. ", #{4:27}
" The next year therefore following Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice men of foot, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them. ", #{4:28}
" So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men. ", #{4:29}
" And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst quell the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest the host of strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and his armourbearer; ", #{4:30}
" Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power and horsemen: ", #{4:31}

" Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and let all those that know thy name praise thee with thanksgiving. ", #{4:33}
" So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even before them were they slain. ", #{4:34}
" Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manliness of Judas' soldiers, and how they were ready either to live or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company of strangers, and having made his army greater than it was, he purposed to come again into Judea. ", #{4:35}
" Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary. ", #{4:36}
" Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion. ", #{4:37}
" And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests' chambers pulled down; ", #{4:38}
" They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads, ", #{4:39}
" And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven. ", #{4:40}
" Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary. ", #{4:41}
" So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law: ", #{4:42}

" And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which was profaned; ", #{4:44}
" They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the heathen had defiled it: wherefore they pulled it down, ", #{4:45}
" And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them. ", #{4:46}
" Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar according to the former; ", #{4:47}
" And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the courts. ", #{4:48}
" They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, and of incense, and the table. ", #{4:49}
" And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps that were upon the candlestick they lighted, that they might give light in the temple. ", #{4:50}
" Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they had begun to make. ", #{4:51}
" Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning, ", #{4:52}
" And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made. ", #{4:53}
" Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it, even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, and harps, and cymbals. ", #{4:54}
" Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heaven, who had given them good success. ", #{4:55}
" And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice of deliverance and praise. ", #{4:56}
" They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers they renewed, and hanged doors upon them. ", #{4:57}
" Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away. ", #{4:58}
" Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness. ", #{4:59}
" At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should come and tread it down as they had done before. ", #{4:60}
" And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura to preserve it; that the people might have a defence against Idumea.", #{4:61}

" And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up this house: and with that he went out in a great rage. ", #{7:35}
" Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple, weeping, and saying, ", #{7:36}
" Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people: ", #{7:37}
" Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer. ", #{7:38}
" So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him. ", #{7:39}
" But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying, ", #{7:40}
" O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundred fourscore and five thousand of them. ", #{7:41}
" Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge thou him according to his wickedness. ", #{7:42}
" So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but Nicanor's host was discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the battle. ", #{7:43}
" Now when Nicanor's host saw that he was slain, they cast away their weapons, and fled. ", #{7:44}
" Then they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa unto Gazera, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets. ", #{7:45}
" Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them that pursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them was left. ", #{7:46}
" Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanors head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem. ", #{7:47}
" For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they kept that day a day of great gladness. ", #{7:48}
" Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth of Adar. ", #{7:49}

" Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his host were slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea the second time, and with them the chief strength of his host: ", #{9:1}
" Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much people. ", #{9:2}
" Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second year they encamped before Jerusalem: ", #{9:3}
" From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horsemen. ", #{9:4}
" Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him: ", #{9:5}
" Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so great were sore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of the host, insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men. ", #{9:6}
" When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and that the battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and much distressed, for that he had no time to gather them together. ", #{9:7}
" Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us arise and go up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able to fight with them. ", #{9:8}
" But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let us now rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with our brethren, and fight against them: for we are but few. ", #{9:9}
" Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, and flee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our honour. ", #{9:10}
" With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents, and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided into two troops, and their slingers and archers going before the host and they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men. ", #{9:11}
" As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drew near on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets. ", #{9:12}
" They also of Judas' side, even they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, and the battle continued from morning till night. ", #{9:13}

" But when they of the left wing saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those that were with him hard at the heels from behind: ", #{9:16}
" Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many were slain on both parts. ", #{9:17}
" Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled. ", #{9:18}

" How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel! ", #{9:21}
" As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, and the noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are not written: for they were very many. ", #{9:22}
" Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity. ", #{9:23}
" In those days also was there a very great famine, by reason whereof the country revolted, and went with them. ", #{9:24}

" And they made enquiry and search for Judas' friends, and brought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, and used them despitefully. ", #{9:26}
" So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them. ", #{9:27}
" For this cause all Judas' friends came together, and said unto Jonathan, ", #{9:28}
" Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are adversaries to us. ", #{9:29}
" Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince and captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles. ", #{9:30}
" Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up instead of his brother Judas. ", #{9:31}
" But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him ", #{9:32}
" Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar. ", #{9:33}
" Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan with all his host upon the sabbath day. ", #{9:34}
" Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of the people, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they might leave with them their carriage, which was much. ", #{9:35}
" But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it. ", #{9:36}
" After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan. ", #{9:37}
" Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain: ", #{9:38}
" Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons. ", #{9:39}
" Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils. ", #{9:40}
" Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation. ", #{9:41}
" So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned again to the marsh of Jordan. ", #{9:42}
" Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath day unto the banks of Jordan with a great power. ", #{9:43}
" Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fight for our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in time past: ", #{9:44}
" For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and the water of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewise and wood, neither is there place for us to turn aside. ", #{9:45}
" Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies. ", #{9:46}
" With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him. ", #{9:47}
" Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan, and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not over Jordan unto them. ", #{9:48}
" So there were slain of Bacchides' side that day about a thousand men. ", #{9:49}
" Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the strong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon, these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with bars. ", #{9:50}
" And in them he set a garrison, that they might work malice upon Israel. ", #{9:51}
" He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals. ", #{9:52}
" Besides, he took the chief men's sons in the country for hostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept. ", #{9:53}
" Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works of the prophets ", #{9:54}
" And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house. ", #{9:55}
" So Alcimus died at that time with great torment. ", #{9:56}
" Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years. ", #{9:57}
" Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold, Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care: now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all in one night. ", #{9:58}
" So they went and consulted with him. ", #{9:59}
" Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take Jonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not, because their counsel was known unto them. ", #{9:60}
" Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them. ", #{9:61}
" Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and they repaired the decays thereof, and made it strong. ", #{9:62}
" Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them that were of Judea. ", #{9:63}
" Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they fought against it a long season and made engines of war. ", #{9:64}
" But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth himself into the country, and with a certain number went he forth. ", #{9:65}
" And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent. ", #{9:66}
" And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces, Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up the engines of war, ", #{9:67}
" And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was in vain. ", #{9:68}
" Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave him counsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to return into his own country. ", #{9:69}
" Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto him, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver them the prisoners. ", #{9:70}

" When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned and went his way into his own land, neither came he any more into their borders. ", #{9:72}

" But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so the enemies' horses were tired. ", #{10:81}
" Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against the footmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited by him, and fled. ", #{10:82}
" The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, for safety. ", #{10:83}
" But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire. ", #{10:84}

" Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet; ", #{14:41}
" Moreover that he should be their captain, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that, I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary; ", #{14:42}

" Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to defend them all. ", #{14:47}
" So they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place; ", #{14:48}
" Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.", #{14:49}

" Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war; ", #{15:3}
" My meaning also being to go through the country, that I may be avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdom desolate: ", #{15:4}
" Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which the kings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted. ", #{15:5}

" And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound. ", #{15:18}
" We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies against them. ", #{15:19}
" It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them. ", #{15:20}
" If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fled from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their own law. ", #{15:21}
" The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces, ", #{15:22}

" So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day, assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he shut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in. ", #{15:25}
" At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aid him; silver also, and gold, and much armour. ", #{15:26}
" Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all the covenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange unto him. ", #{15:27}

" The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom. ", #{15:29}
" Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and the tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea: ", #{15:30}
" Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight against you ", #{15:31}
" So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem: and when he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him the king's message. ", #{15:32}
" Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither taken other men's land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certain time. ", #{15:33}
" Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of our fathers. ", #{15:34}
" And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they did great harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give thee an hundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word; ", #{15:35}
" But returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto him of these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth. ", #{15:36}
" In the mean time fled Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias. ", #{15:37}
" Then the king made Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an host of footmen and horsemen, ", #{15:38}
" And commanded him to remove his host toward Judea; also he commanded him to build up Cedron, and to fortify the gates, and to war against the people; but as for the king himself, he pursued Tryphon. ", #{15:39}
" So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and to invade Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and slay them. ", #{15:40}
" And when he had built up Cedrou, he set horsemen there, and an host of footmen, to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.", #{15:41}

" Then came up John from Gazera, and told Simon his father what Cendebeus had done. ", #{16:1}
" Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said unto them, I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have ever from my youth unto this day fought against the enemies of Israel; and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes. ", #{16:2}

" So he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war with horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested that night at Modin. ", #{16:4}
" And when as they rose in the morning, and went into the plain, behold, a mighty great host both of footmen and horsemen came against them: howbeit there was a water brook betwixt them. ", #{16:5}
" So he and his people pitched over against them: and when he saw that the people were afraid to go over the water brook, he went first over himself, and then the men seeing him passed through after him. ", #{16:6}
" That done, he divided his men, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: for the enemies' horsemen were very many. ", #{16:7}

" Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son of Abubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold: ", #{16:11}

" Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get the country to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons to destroy them. ", #{16:13}
" Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them; at which time he came down himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias and Judas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth year, in the eleventh month, called Sabat: ", #{16:14}
