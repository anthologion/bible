# King James Version (With Deuterocanon)

##Editing Notes
This version does *not* attempt to stay faitful to any sort of original
typesetting. In particular, words that were bracked as words inserted by the
translators have been retained in-line with no special formatting.

The Psalms are not separated into their individual books.
